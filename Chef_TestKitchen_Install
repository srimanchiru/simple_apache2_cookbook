Install Test Kitchen, VAGRANT and VirtualBox:
Chef Test Kitchen: Test Kitchen is a testing tool that can execute your CHEF recipes on one or more platforms in isolation. A driver plugin architecture is used which lets you run your recipes on various cloud providers and virtualization technologies.
CHEF test kitchen has enabled us to reduce new cookbook/recipes testing time to minutes by provisioning VAGRANT box on our local workstation.


Kitchen.yml can be created in chef-repo directory or in the recipe directory. If you initialize kitchen in recipe directory, recipe name will be automatically added to the kitchen.yml.

You can create kitchen.yml file in the chef-repo directory (as shown below) or in specific cookbook directory.

C:\chef-repo\cookbooks\simple_apache2_cookbook>kitchen init
      create  kitchen.yml
      create  chefignore
      create  test/integration/default

c:\chef-workspace\chefrepo> kitchen list
$ kitchen list
